# Autonomous-Navigation-and-Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot
The goal of the project was to build a mechatronic robot capable of accurately identifying its current location in a pre-constructed maze and thus be able to navigate through the maze to reach its destination and complete the task of picking-and-placing a payload from one location to another and simulatneously avoiding obstacles as it moves.
